# Django React/Redux Base Project - creating new repository

This repository includes a boilerplate project. It uses Django as backend and React as frontend.

## Creating New Repository

1. Create new repo [directly on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/).  
   To avoid conflicts, make sure it will be empty (without README and other files).
   And probably you will want to make this a private repository.
2. Fetch the project starter code (you probably did this already)  
   `git clone git@github.com:stxnext/project-starter.git`
3. go to main directory  
   `cd project-starter`
4. remove current git directory  
   `rm -rf .git`
5. Initialize local directory as a git repo  
   `git init`
6. Add current content  
   `git add .`
7. Make first commit  
   `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
8. connect this repo to repo created with 1st step  
   `git remote add origin git@github.com:<accout>/<project_name>.git`
9. push newly created repo to github  
   `git push origin master`
